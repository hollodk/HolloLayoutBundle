Introduction
------------

This bundle is pretty much to ease deployment of my new projects. This bundle just contain a bunch of different styles.


Dependency
----------

This bundle depends on HolloMenuBundle, but you are free to hack the bundle to fit your needs.


Getting started
---------------

Add the bundle to any of your existing projects, now all you have to do is:

  - Add the bundle to AppKernel.php
  - Add the bundle to autoload.php
  - Add the route to config/route.yml

Twig configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remember to add the following options to app/config/config.yml.

twig:
    form:
      resources:
        - 'HolloLayoutBundle::fields.html.twig'
    globals:
      logo: bundles/hollolayout/images/logo.gif


TODO
----

  - Make sure left menu works
  - Fix top right menu
  - Create some dynamic handling of logout
  - Cleanup in the icons folder
  - Create a html login form
