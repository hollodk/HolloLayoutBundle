Introduction
------------

This bundle is pretty much to ease deployment of my new projects. This bundle just contain a bunch of different styles.


Dependency
----------

This bundle depends on HolloMenuBundle, but you are free to hack the bundle to fit your needs.


TODO
----

  - Make sure left menu works
  - Fix top right menu
  - Create some dynamic handling of logout
  - Cleanup in the icons folder
  - Create a html login form
